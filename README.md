# ImageProcessing

This repository contains several image processing projects carried out. 
1. Image Signal Processor: In this project I am carrying out basic image processing tasks on an image.
2. Bar code detection: In this project we are detecting barcode using opencv.
3. Fisheye calibration: In this project we are performing fisheye calibration on chessboard images using DrawChessBoard corners of opencv to obtain the corner points.
4. Panorama Stitching: In this project we are performing panorama stitching on different images.
5. Lane Detection: In this project we will be detecting lane using canny edge detector and other opencv functions.
6. Park Slot Detection: Here we are having 2 parts. In the first part, we are generating bird eye view / topview of a parking slot using panorama stitching. In the second part, we are highlighting available parking space and detecting cars parked using ResNet50 pretrained model.
